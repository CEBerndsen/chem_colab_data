For simple assignments, this is correct, however we may want to look at a set of data and will assign multiple values to a single name. For example, a student measures the pH value for one solution five times to determine the accuracy and precision of their measurement. The values are 4.9, 5.1, 5.1, 4.8, and 5.0. To calculate the average value and the error, you could type in each number into a calculator or the R console and do all the math. Alternatively, you could assign these values to a single name and simplify your typing. In doing this, you save yourself some effort and reduce the opportunities for errors.\n",

The `[]` takes multiple inputs and combines them into a single unit which we name. The values are entered between the `[]` separated by commas. If we take the pH values from the above section and put them into `[]`, our result is:\n",
