        "# Visualizing protein-ligand binding sites\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial is aimed at using [ProLIF](https://prolif.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to generate an interaction site image (also called a fingerprint) for protein-ligand complexes. There are several preparation steps which you need to follow before generating an interaction fingerprint with ProLIF. This type of analysis and the resulting visuals are important for communicating results clearly to your audience and provides an automated way to identify potential interactions. This approach does not replace manual analysis of the interactions in Mol*, pyMol, or other software! This automated analysis should be used alongside manual analysis and confirmation of the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "This colab assumes that you have already docked a ligand to the protein through any method. The outputs used to create this colab come from  [Uni_dock colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hV3pwwYMr8Peg37JGnyZ_uipy08YbhUC?usp=sharing) which produces ligand binding poses in .sdf format.\n",

        "3.   Clicking the \"play\" button to the top left of a code block runs the code. Sometimes you can see the code and interact with it. However, if the code is hidden  it is to run adminstrative tasks in the background and you do not need to worry unless you are interested.\n",
        "4. Sometimes the code may be hidden from view. To view it, click the '>' on the left of the title, until it changes to 'v'. This will reveal the code in that line.\n",

        "1. A .pdb file with explict hydrogens. This means all of the hydrogens are there already. If you used the Uni_dock colab to docking the molecules, use the **receptor.pdb** file produced in step 2.\n",
        "2. A .sdf file of the ligand from the docking software. From the Uni_dock colab, these would be the files produced some step 9. Only one ligand site can be visualized at a time in this workflow.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this code takes 20 minutes or less to visualize the binding site. Comparison of multiple ligands will increase the run time.\n",
