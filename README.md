# Colab activities and data

Data and notebooks for coding workshops and tutorials offered through the JMU Chemistry and Biochemistry REU program or classes in the Department. All notebooks are either in R or Python. All tutorials have a chemistry or biology focus and are for those who are new to coding.

In both the R and Python Colabs directories are folders with notebooks for molecular dynamics, ligand docking, and other scientific applications. These notebooks are used in course-based undergraduate research projects and are designed for low/no code situations. These notebooks are provided 'as-is' and should be used with the caution and skepticism of a good scientist.

All Colabs are a product of members of the Berndsen lab at JMU, though some notebooks have been adapted from other sources. Please see the information in the notebook for those sources.

Most data were cleaned and prepped by Chris Berndsen. Data references are in the Colab file which uses the data, if no reference, assume the data were generated or assembled by the Berndsen lab
