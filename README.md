# Colab activities and data

Data and notebooks for coding workshops and tutorials offered through the JMU Chemistry and Biochemistry REU program or classes in the Department. All notebooks are either in R or Python.

All Colabs are a product of the Berndsen lab at JMU, though some have been adapted from other sources. Please see the information in the notebook for those sources.

Data cleaned and prepped by Chris Berndsen. Data references are in the Colab file which uses the data, if no reference, assume the data were generated or assembled by the Berndsen lab
